simple factory:
  we create a factory class and a static method to create and return requested object. 
  we can use switch case with enum to check and return respective object.
factory method:
  the simple factory is very redundent and if we want to add new type we have to modify the existing method.
  simple factory violates SRP and OCP principles.
  so we create multiple child classes for diffent types.
